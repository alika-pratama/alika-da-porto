# [Project 8 : Predicting Steel Reinforcement Bar Price Compared to IHSG, CNY, and USD using Artificial Neural Network](https://github.com/alika-pratama/predicting-rebar)
- Prediction of the unit price of steel reinforcement bar compared to the price of IDX Composite (IHSG), USD, and CNY
- Using the Artificial Neural Network
- The historical data of the steel unit price was taken from my company's previous purchase data from 2018 to 2021
- This prediction could be useful in a procurement phase of a project, to help the project estimate the budget and also while negotiating with the vendor, to determine whether or not the quoted unit price is reasonable.
- The model has an absolute error by Rp. 365/kg, which means the predicted result may differ in a range from +365 to -365
